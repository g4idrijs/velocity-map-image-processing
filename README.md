# velocity-map-image-processing
A velocity map imaging processing suite for automated centroiding, masking, multipeak fitting, and visualization with numerical and computer vision libraries.

## Dependencies

* Python 2+ (tested on 2.7.6 MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel))
 * opencv (2.4.13)
 * numpy (1.11. 2)
 * matplotlib (2.0.0b4)
 * scipy (0.18.1)
 
## Overview

**velocity-map-image-processing** is designed to process 2D imaging data recorded from a velocity-map imaging apparatus where two distinct velocity components are present. However, this could be adpated/applied to any image data where two components are present.
It was created for use with python 2.7.6 on the Windows command line. While not tested on a Posix system, it should theoretically work. Image data is processed according to the following steps.

* Part 1: Centroid (`centroid.py`)
 * read, reshape, and subset 1D data column into 2D numpy data
 * mask data (if mask supplied)
 * threshold
 * find contours and moments (centroids)
 * plot/save centroid/mask visualizations
 
* Part 2: Slicing & Fitting (`slice_fit.py`)
 * extract data slice along line defined by two centroids
 * fit two gaussians to data slice using centroids as guess
 * plot/save slice, fits, and parameters

## Usage

velocity-map-image-processing is executed with two scritps ([centroid.py](centroid.py), [slice_fit.py](slice_fit.py)). These are called from the command line with user-specified arguments.

```
python centroid.py \path\to\data threshold minimum_area mask_name 

python slice_fit.py \path\to\data centroid_1_x centroid_1_y centroid_2_x centroid_2_y
```

### Without Masking

Using this script with the provided [sample.dat](sample.dat).

```
C:\path\to\script> python centroid.py sample.dat 20 30 

No Masking.

centroids = 78 156 148 162
distance = 70
userThreshold = 20
area minimum = 30
```

This will generate 4 files:
* grey scale .png of the subset data

![centroids](./images/sample.png)

* .png and .pdf indicating the centroids, thresholded image, and contour regions

![centroids](./images/sample_CENTROIDS.png)

* text file containg the centroids and parameters

[sample_CENTROIDS.txt](sample_CENTROIDS.txt)

Now using those centroid points from we can fit the data along the slice between the two centroid points.

```
C:\path\to\script> python slice_fit.py sample.dat 78 156 148 162
```
This generates 5 files:
* an .png visualizing the line of data sliced through the centroids
![centroids](./images/sample_LINE.png)
* .png and .pdf demonstrating the multi-peak gaussian fitting along the data slice
![centroids](./images/sample_FITS.png)
* text file containg the data slice, fits, fits sum, residuals
[sample_CENTROIDS.txt](sample_FITS.txt)


### Introduction

In my collaborative research at Berkeley Labs, we use a silicon carbide (SiC) thermal reactor nozzle to probe chemistry at high temperatures (25 - 1500C). One of the problems we faced in these studies was determing how close the temperature of the reactor (measured with a thermocouple) is to the temperature of the gas inside the reactor. By using a technique known as velocity map imaging we can 'ionize' the hot gas and image the ions as a function of their velocity. Since temperature can be considered to be a measure of average kinetic energy (velocity) we can use this technique to determine the average temperature of the gas. The experimental schematic is depicted below in figure 1.
